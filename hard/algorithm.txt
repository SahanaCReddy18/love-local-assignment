1.Function Definition (countDigitOne):
Define a function countDigitOne that takes an integer n as input.

2.Initialize Variables:
Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the total number of digit 1 occurrences.
Initialize factor to 1, and i to 1.

3.Loop until i is Less than or Equal to n:
Enter a while loop that continues until i is greater than n.

4.Inside the loop:
Calculate divider as i multiplied by 10.
Increment count using the formula: (n // divider) * i + min(max(n % divider - i + 1, 0), i).
Update i by multiplying it by 10.

5.Return Result:
Return the final count as the result of the function.

6.User Input:
Take user input for the value of n using input("Enter the value of n: ").

7.Function Invocation and Print Result:
Call the countDigitOne function with the user-input value as an argument to get the result.
Print the total number of digit 1 occurrences in numbers up to n.
